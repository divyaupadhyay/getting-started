# Padrino tutorial.

Getting started :).

## What's this all about?

[padrino-tutorial](https://github.com/padrino-tutorial) is an effort to make a live Padrino tutorial from the ground up going from 0 to a web app led by [Ankita](https://github.com/ankitashukla) and [Divya](https://github.com/divyaupadhyay) and guided by [Dar√≠o](https://github.com/dariocravero).

## So you do it live, right?

Well, that's the idea. We'll be doing hangouts every now and then as we build our Chat application.
We chose a Chat app because the concept simple enough to grasp but it's still complex enough for us to showcase all the building blocks of the app at the end of the day.

## The "knowledge milestones"

The "knowledge milestones", or the topics we'll cover, will highly likely be the following (the order isn't strict):
