# Padrino tutorial.

Getting started :).

## What's this all about?

[padrino-tutorial](https://github.com/padrino-tutorial) is an effort to make a live Padrino tutorial from the ground up going from 0 to a web app led by [Ankita](https://github.com/ankitashukla) and [Divya](https://github.com/divyaupadhyay) and guided by [Dar√≠o](https://github.com/dariocravero).

## So you do it live, right?

Well, that's the idea. We'll be doing hangouts every now and then as we build our Chat application.
We chose a Chat app because the concept simple enough to grasp but it's still complex enough for us to showcase all the building blocks of the app at the end of the day.

## The "knowledge milestones"

*`TODO` cleanup notes.*

The "knowledge milestones", or the topics we'll cover, will highly likely be the following (the order isn't strict):

- layout the idea / problem being solved;

- setup the environment:

    I'd love to showcase postmodern's concepts -we've been using chruby and its friends in production for a long while now and they truly shine.

- build a minimal prototype that works:

    highly likely in Sinatra and evolve it (thoughts?);

- implement a backend API:

    we'll touch base with generators, helpers, models, plugins;

- implement the client side of it:

    since we would be building an API approach I'd suggest evolve to some JS rendering at some point - fairly simple;

    implement asset management;

    implement stylesheets in scss;

- introduce/implement versioned APIs:
    multiple apps, etc.;

- implement websockets;

- introduce deployments:

    deploy to heroku for quick startup;

    introduce minimal server configuration (web server, application server, database, etc.) and probably deploy to something
    like Digital Ocean.

- introduce/implement an admin:

    we'll probably use the admin :);

- introduce caching concepts:

    at least in-app with Moneta;

- introduce events/background processing:

    maybe using a task that may delay stuff like sending an email plus we get to showcase the mailer

    we've been using Ost and besides it being extremely simple and small (it passes messages through Redis) it's very robust.

- gemify everything for a simple distribution.

- how to use jruby (would this be of interest?)
